# Overloaded Operators

Similar to pytorch, we have overloaded some operators to fit the code style of PyTorch developers.

Operators overloaded by PyDec:

| Operator | API           | Description                      |
| -------- | ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| []       | `__getitem__` | Evaluation of `self[key]`        |
| []       | `__setitem__` | Assignment to `self[key]`        |
| +        | `__pos__`     | The unary arithmetic operations  |
| -        | `__neg__`     | The unary arithmetic operations  |
| +        | `__add__`     | The binary arithmetic operations |
| -        | `__sub__`     | The binary arithmetic operations |
| @        | `__matmul__`  | The binary arithmetic operations |
| *        | `__mul__`     | The binary arithmetic operations |
| /        | `__truediv__` | The binary arithmetic operations |
| ==       | `__eq__`      | The "rich comparison" methods    |
| >        | `__gt__`      | The "rich comparison" methods    |
| <        | `__lt__`      | The "rich comparison" methods    |
| >=       | `__ge__`      | The "rich comparison" methods    |
| <=       | `__le__`      | The "rich comparison" methods    |

The behavior of these operators is similar to the definition of pytoch, but some of them have been added with additional functionality. Refer to {% include doc.html name="pydec.Composition()" path="pythonapi/pydec.Composition" %} for detailed definitions.
