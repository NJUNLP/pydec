PyDec is a linear decomposition toolkit for neural network based on [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), which can decompose the tensors in the forward process into given components. The result of decomposition can be applied to tasks such as attribution analysis.

## Features:
* Fast. Compute decomposition in foward process and benefit from GPU acceleration.
* Run once, decompose anywhere. Obtain the decomposition of all hidden states (if you saved them) in forward propagation.
* Applicable to networks such as Transformer, CNN and RNN.
