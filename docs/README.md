## Welcome to PyDec Documentation

PyDec is a linear decomposition toolkit for neural network based on [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), which can decompose the tensors in the forward process into given components. The result of decomposition can be applied to tasks such as attribution analysis.

## Features:
* Fast. Compute decomposition in foward process and benefit from GPU acceleration.
* Real-time. Outputs attribution along with the model output results.
* Applicable to networks such as Transformer, CNN and RNN.

## Examples

Check out the [examples](https://github.com/DoubleVII/pydec/tree/master/examples) to see the use of pydec on real-world models.
